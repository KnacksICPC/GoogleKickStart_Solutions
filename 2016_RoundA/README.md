JaneFlowerShop.cpp: From the spec, "answers are accepted within error of 1e-6", and thus we know it is either binary search or tenary search. For binary search, we need to make sure the function is strictly increasing or strictly decreasing. Fortunately, even though the degree of our function is very high (up to 100), the spec guaranteed us that "there is exactly one solution in each test case". So we know that we are safe to use binary search. From the spec we also learnt that -1 < r < 1, and earning in each month is positive. If we plug in r=-1 to any of our functions, for example, -10000*(1+r)^3+3000*(1+r)^2+4000*(1+r)+5000=0, we would notice that every term that is multiplied with (1+r) evaluates to 0 and we are left with a positive value (in this case, 5000). So we know that our function started off to be greater than 0 at r=-1, gradually decreases as r increases, and at some point the funtion evaluates to 0, at which point we get our answer for r. With all that being said, we can run a binary search between -1 and 1, and look for our answer r.
