diwaliLightings.py: We can simulate the process with modulo operations.

beautifulNumbers.py: We want to find if (X^(N+1)-1)/(X-1)==A has an integer answer. Since the derivative is always positive, we can fix N and binary search on X. Note that fixing X will not work, because there are so many possibilities for X, whereas N can only take values in the range \[2,64].

partitioningNumber.cpp: We iterate over all possible length of the sequence L. For a fixed L, there are at most 3 possibilities for the starting value A at the left most bucket. For each of these 3 possibilities, if we fix the length of A to be n1, then there is a unique solution for the length of A+1 (let us call it n2) and the length of A+2 (let us call it n3). We can calculate the lower bound of n1 by taking as much n3 and as fewer n2 as possible, and we can calculate the upper bound of n1 by taking as much n2 and as fewer n3 as possible. Thus for each fixed L and fixed A, the result is increased by (upper bound of n1- lower bound of n1), since each n1 determines a unique combination of n2 and n3. Note that to avoid repetition, we can set minimum bound for n1,n2 or n3. For example, if we want all three values (A, A+1, A+2) to be present, we would set their minimum bound to be 1.
