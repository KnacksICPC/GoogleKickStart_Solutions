diwaliLightings.py: We can simulate the process with modulo operations.

beautifulNumbers.py: We want to find if (X^(N+1)-1)/(X-1)==A has an integer answer. Since the derivative is always positive, we can fix N and binary search on X. Note that fixing X will not work, because there are so many possibilities for X, whereas N can only take values in the range \[2,64].
