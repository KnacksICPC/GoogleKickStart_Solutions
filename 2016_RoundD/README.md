vote.cpp: let dp\[i]\[j] be the probability of, obtaining a sequence of length i with j number of As in it, and A is in the lead all the time. The base case is dp\[1]\[1]=N/M+N. Now for each dp\[i]\[j], we consider whether the last person is A or B. If the last person is A, we can safely let dp\[i]\[j]+=dp\[i-1]\[j-1]\*(probability of selecting A), because adding an A to an already valid seqence is still valid. On the other hand, if the last person is B, we could encounter scenarios where appending a B makes the sequence invalid. e.g. appending "B" to valid seqence "AAB" makes an invalid sequence "AABB". Thus we have to make sure the total number of As is at least greater than half of the current length. After that, we can let dp\[i]\[j]+=dp\[i-1]\[j]\*(probability of selecting B).
