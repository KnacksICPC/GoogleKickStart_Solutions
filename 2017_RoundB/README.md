center.cpp: The function is unimodal on x axis and y axis (We can verify this statement by fixing one dimension and observing the other). We can use tenary serach on the two dimensions.  

christmasTree.cpp: Bottom-up dp is easier to code and organize. Let dp\[i]\[j]\[k] be the maximum area covered by a k-christmas tree whose tree top is at position (i,j). For every possible 1-christmas tree T whose tree top is at (i,j), there could be a potential (k-1)-christmas tree whose tree top starts just beneath T. Let the height of T be L. Thus, the dp relation is dp\[i]\[j]\[k]=max(area covered by T + dp\[s]\[t]\[k-1]) for every t in the range\[j-L,j+L] and s==i+L. To calculate area covered by T and also L, we can run a simple dp. Let h\[i]\[j] be the maximum height of a 1-christmas tree whose tree top is at (i,j). Then h\[i]\[j]=min(h\[i+1]\[j-1],h\[i+1]\[j],h\[i+1]\[j+1])+1. In other words, the maximum height of every 1-christmas tree whose tree top is at (i,j), can be calculated from the minimum of the, maximum height of the three potential 1-christmax tree that starts at (i+1,j-1),(i+1,j) and (i+1,j+1).
